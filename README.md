# Opificina
Our project is a platform that helps businesses to seek a way to connect with their customers in an easy and exclusive manner.


Our scope and aim is to find a way to easily connect common users and consumers around the wrold with businesses.


For this purpose we have built a PWA that provides an integrated interface for the stakeholders
Businesses are let to register and easily customize their portfolios without any coding effort.
Within a few clicks they would have their very own catalogue that uniquely identifies each brand.
